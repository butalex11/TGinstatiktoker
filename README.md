# üì• Telegram Social Network Video Downloader Bot

A simple Telegram bot that downloads videos from **Instagram**, **TikTok**, **YouTube Shorts** links sent by users and returns them as downloadable files directly in the chat.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1\. **User Interaction**  
   A user sends a message containing a **link** in any Telegram chat where the bot is present (private or group). The bot **MUST** have administrator privileges to properly monitor messages and respond to link events

2\. **Link Processing**  
   The bot detects the link, validates it, and fetches the video from the respective platform using supported APIs or scraping tools.

3\. **Video Delivery**  
   Once the video is downloaded, the bot sends it back to the chat as a **file attachment**, along with:
   - The **username** of the sender
   - A **clickable link** to the original video

---

## üì¶ Features

- Supports **Instagram Reels**, **TikTok videos**, **YouTube Shorts videos**
- Sends videos as **files** (not just links or previews)
- Includes **attribution** (who sent the link and link to original video URL of downloaded media)
- Processes requests sequentially, one at a time
- **Error reporting to admin group** with detailed logs (option)

## üõ† Requirements

- Docker
- Instagram and TikTok cookie file (optional, for private and 18+ videos)

---

## üìå Instagram and TikTok Cookies

üß© Instructions for Google Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers like Brave, Edge)

If you're downloading videos from Instagram or TikTok, you may need to authenticate using your cookies. Here's how to export them:  
üîå Install the Extension

 Go to the Chrome Web Store and install the "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension  
  üëâ Direct Link (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)

üîê Log in to Instagram or TikTok

 Open a new tab and go to https://www.instagram.com or https://www.tiktok.com
 
 Log in to your account

üì§ Export the Cookies

 While on the Instagram or Tiktok website, click the extensions icon (üß©) in your browser's toolbar  
 Find and click on "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" from the dropdown list  
 A new window will pop up ‚Äî click the "Export" button

üìÅ File is Downloaded

 Your browser will download a file, likely named www.instagram.com_cookies.txt or www.tiktok.com_cookies.txt, to your Downloads folder  
 Rename file to cookies1.txt or cookie_tiktok1.txt and put to ```/path/to/instaloader/cookies``` folder

üîÑ **Multiple Sessions for Fault Tolerance**

The bot supports multiple Instagram or TikTok sessions for enhanced reliability. Place multiple cookie files in the same folder with names following the pattern (Instagram):
- `cookies1.txt`
- `cookies2.txt`
- `cookies3.txt`
- And so on...

TikTok pattern:
- `cookie_tiktok1.txt`
- `cookie_tiktok2.txt`
- `cookie_tiktok3.txt`
- And so on...

The bot will automatically iterate through these files if one session becomes invalid or hits a rate limit. This ensures greater fault tolerance and availability. Cookies are always used sequentially, even if one of them fails ‚Äî the bot will continue with the next available session

---

## üö® Error Reporting

The bot includes automatic error reporting functionality:

- When a download fails after all retry attempts (or one of the cookie in rotation also), the bot sends a notification to the admin group
- Error reports include:
  - Timestamp and platform information
  - Brief error description
  - Detailed error log as a text file attachment (including yt-dlp logs)
  - User and chat context information

To enable error reporting, set the `ADMIN_GROUP_ID` environment variable with your admin group's ID.
